# WaterparkAdventures
 A project made for 13th anual (2020) FIT coding challenge.
 The project has won 2nd place in the challenge.
 
 The project in question is a low polly 3rd person game set in a waterpark. The objective is to participate in water battles against evergrowing number of enemies. The game is organised in levels, each level brings more and more enemies to fight against. It also has a primitive, proof of concept type, currency and shopping system. 
 
 The project has been completed by a single developer (me) and all 3D assets used are also completely mine. The time spent on the project is 2,5 monhts.
 
 The project is far from complete and serves as a proof of concept, something I worked on in my free time. Everyone is free to try it out and give feedback.
